## Overview
This project explores **end-to-end causal reasoning** within a **closed-loop interactive learning** framework.  
Our aim is to enable intelligent systemsâ€”especially robotsâ€”to not only perceive and act, but also to **understand causal relations**, make safer and more robust decisions, and continually refine their knowledge through real-world interactions.

Key features:
- **Causal Reasoning**: Moving beyond correlation to explain *why* things happen.  
- **Closed-loop Interaction**: Acting, observing feedback, and adapting in real time.  
- **Safety & Robustness**: Building **firewalls** for dangerous situations and ensuring **resilience against interference**.  
- **End-to-end Integration**: From perception to reasoning to action, all in a unified pipeline.  

## Research Goals
- Develop robots capable of **safe, controllable, and robust actions** through causal reasoning.  
- Build a scalable framework that combines **vision, language, and action** in a closed-loop setting.  
- Explore applications in **robotic manipulation, humanâ€“AI collaboration, and autonomous decision-making**.  


## Milestones

- [X] Achieve Fundamental Object Manipulation â€“ Implement and validate simple, reliable object operation skills.
- [X] Demonstrate Robustness Against Disturbances â€“ Ensure stable performance under external interference.
- [X] Enable Emergency Stopping â€“ Integrate immediate halt mechanisms for hazardous situations.
- [ ] Develop Hazard Handling and Recovery â€“ Equip the system to address risks and safely resume task execution.
- [ ] Reach Generalizable Task Execution â€“ Extend capabilities to perform a wide range of tasks across different environments.
